# NumPy-RNN-LSTM

Realize RNN and LSTM based on NumPy. In this work, we mimicked pytorch to build our Class NN and ML. In Class NN, we used a directionatry to store the weight of NN; In Class ML, we constructed different parameter initialization methods as well as different optimizers. In the end, we used Sine function to test you work.
